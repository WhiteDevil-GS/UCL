        <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At the time of serve, if the ring strikes/touches the net, the opponent gains the point.</li>
            <li>During a rally, if the ring touches the net and moves to the other court, the game continues. If the ring strikes the net and comes back to the same court, the opponent will gain the point.</li>
            <li>Only one hand may be used to catch the ring. A player cannot switch the ring from one hand to another.</li>
            <li>If the ring touches the ground, the opponent gains a point.</li>
            <li>If the ring is thrown poorly, resulting in a wobbling motion, the receiving team may call "wobble" before it is touched but must still attempt to catch the ring.</li>
            <li>If the "wobble" is dropped, the point is replayed.</li>
            <li>If the ring wobbles but is not touched by the receiving team, the shot is good. But it shouldn't be misused.</li>
            <li>If a player ends up on the ground after diving to catch the ring, she must also throw the ring from this position.</li>
            <li>The referee's decision is final.</li>
        </ul>
